* TODO

** Test on several different Systems!

*** Work out any major bugs I can't see on my machine.

*** Get responses on what the users would like.

** Make Cairo, Pango, and FreeImage optional.

*** These dependencies are causing problems with my Window's users.

** Fix "Out of memory error", on Syspops's machine.

*** I assume others will have his issue.


*** Also assuming it has something to do with my texture object.

** Create a sane way to work with cameras.

*** I'm open to ideas!

** Create helper macros for the 2D vector libraries: With-Mapped-Texture-Context, Load-Texture-From-File, etc. 

*** Again, users are important.

** Look for performance issues.

** Create more and better examples.

** Get user feedback on the design.

** ???? Please add more here, everyone!
